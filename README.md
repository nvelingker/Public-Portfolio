### About Me
My name is Neelay Velingker and I am a sophomore studying electrical engineering and computer science at UC Berkeley!  I began coding when I was about 15 years old when a family friend taught me how to solve my math homework in Java; from there on I learned the rest of the language and started building computer and mobile applications.

### Public Projects
- Kolb Library - A mobile app that is intended to replace aging public library catalogue systems built by [Chris Seiler](https://cdseiler.com/), [Tejas Priyadarshi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tejas-priyadarshi/), and myself.  What had originally started as a coding competition entry quickly turned into a full, open-source replacement for public library systems.  Our system persists of a mobile application, written in Java for Android, an EC2 application server written in Java, and an RDS database built on SQL.  The project went on to win first place in the FBLA International Mobile Application Development Category as well as a congressional award during the 2018 Congressional App Challenge.

- PolyDroid - An active learning platform built by [Brian Heath](http://brianheath.info/) and myself under the supervision of [Professor Mayur Naik](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mhnaik/) at the University of Pennsylvania.  The system aims to automatically configure mobile applications such that they minimize resource usage (CPU, battery, network, etc.) while still maintaining usability and acceptability by the end user.  Our proposed technic involved combining developer-specified app configurations and user experiences to determine the minima.  [Read our paper here.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09589)
