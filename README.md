# About Me
My name is Neelay Velingker and I am a sophomore studying electrical engineering and computer science at UC Berkeley!  I began coding when I was about 15 years old when a family friend taught me how to solve my math homework in Java.  From there on I learned the rest of the language and started building computer and mobile applications.
